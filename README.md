# 🫀 Heart Disease Prediction App (ML + DL + Streamlit)

This project is a complete **end-to-end application** for predicting heart disease risk using both **Machine Learning (KNN)** and **Deep Learning (Neural Networks)** models, wrapped inside an interactive **Streamlit web app**.

## 🔍 Features

- 🔢 Trained KNN (ML) & Deep Learning (DL) models
- ⚙️ Scaled & preprocessed input data
- 📊 Streamlit web app UI
- 🧠 Model selector (ML or DL)
- 🧪 Trained models and scaler included

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3.10  
- Streamlit  
- Scikit-learn  
- TensorFlow / Keras  
- Pandas, NumPy, Joblib  

## 🚀 How to Run

# Step 1: Activate virtual environment (if created)
.\tfenv\Scripts\activate

# Step 2: Run the Streamlit app
python -m streamlit run app.py

 ## Model Performance
Model	Accuracy	F1 Score
KNN (ML)	88.59%	89.86%
DL Model	85.00%	85.00%

✅ KNN gives slightly better performance, but both models are available in the app.
